# BattDeg

## Usecases for the project

* To predict the degradation in a lithium-ion battery using the few cycles of usage. 

## Components

## Usage Instructions 

This Python package contains following functions: 

1. `PL_samples_file_reader()`: This function reads the files from PL_samples experiment. TODO: Test for other files this PL12 14 folder, then other folders in PL_samples experiment. Then work on optimization. 

## Future Scope 

1. Convert the files from .mat format to .csv in Python. 
2. Include ability to train for multiple chemistries, voltage windows etc. 
3.
